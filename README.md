# Caesar Cipher Suite

My version of a simple and flexible command line-based Python implementation of the Caesar cipher.

## Overview

My project implements a basic Caesar transposition cipher with encryption and decryption capabilties that runs in the terminal. 
It is designed to be easy to use and offers flexibility through custom shift keys which makes the cipher adaptable to your needs. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (No additional dependencies required)


## Features

- **Command Line Interface:**  
  Runs directly from your CLI & is easily accessible.

- **Custom Shift Keys:**  
  You can Input your own unique shift key to customise the encryption of your plaintext & decryption of your ciphertext.

- **Input Sanitisation & Validation:**  
  Built-in input validation ensures that users receive helpful error messages in case of mistakes & allows special characters [$, #, .... etc] to function with the cipher as well.

## Installation & Use

1. 
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Quantum-git/Caesar-Cipher-Suite.git
2.
    ```bash
    cd Caesar-Cipher-Suite

3.
